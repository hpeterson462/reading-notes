## *What Google Learned About Teams*

* Project Aristole - 
    * Research into "group norms"
    * Right norms can raise group's collective intellegence
* Good teams always have:
    * members speak at the same proportion
    * high "average social sensitivity" - able to distiguish what someone else is feeling - empathy


## *HTML & CSS Transforms*

* Transform syntax:
    * `div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}`
* 2D transforms: 
    * distorted on 2D or 3D plane
    * 2D rotate
    * 2D scale - height and width
    * 2D translate - relative positioning - x and y axis
    * 2D skew - distorts on x or y axis
    * transform origin
    * perspective - depth, origin
3D transforms:
    * rotate
    * scale
    * translate
    * skew
    * back visibility
    * cube 


## *Transitions & Animations*

* element must change state - different styles need to be indentified for each state
* Transitions:
    * property
    * duration
    * timing
    * delay
