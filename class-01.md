* browser needs DOCUTYPE to tell which version of HTML is used
* `<!-- -->` comment in code
* use id and class to name elements
* `<div>` block elements
* `<span>` inline elements
* `<iframes>` create windows into page that display other pages
* `<meta>` contains info about page that doesn't display on page (always in `<head>`)
* escape characters used to display specific symbols (`&copy`, `&amp`, `&quot`)
